lab 1: My table 
description:
This code creates a simple interactive HTML table with two buttons — "Insert row" and "delete row". The table starts with 5 rows.
Clicking "Insert row" adds a new row to the bottom of the table with incremented row numbers like Row6 Col1, Row6 Col2, and so on. 
Clicking "delete row" removes the first row from the table. If all rows are deleted, a message is displayed: “Message: No more rows to delete”.
When a new row is inserted after all rows are gone, the message clears and row numbering continues from where it left off (e.g., Row8, Row9, etc.). 
The code uses JavaScript DOM methods to manipulate table rows dynamically.
used of function, style, button and table tags.
